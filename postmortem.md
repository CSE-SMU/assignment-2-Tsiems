# Assignment 2 Postmortem

## How difficult was this assignment?

Medium level of difficulty for the time frame, having little experience with CSS.

## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?

Yes. I'm getting much more familiar with CSS, but still having trouble with positioning.
I typically just put in a number and play with it until it finally is where it needs to be.
And I don't get the difference between absolute and relative position yet.

## Did you use any of the links provided in the homework? If so, which ones?

I used the centering one, and the :before/:after one.
The Bullet one didn't really help, I just googled "CSS Bullet" and found an encoding for it.

## How could this assignment be improved?

A little more explanation of using the :before/:after pseudo elements would be great.
I did not understand how to move the content separately from the background;
I think I just got lucky for the nose.

## Any other comments?

I liked this as an assignment to get used to CSS, but how practical will our newfound
knowledge be for building websites?
